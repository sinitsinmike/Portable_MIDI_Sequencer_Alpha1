# Alpha1 — Portable Hardware MIDI Sequencer (Public Alpha)

Alpha1 is a compact, performance-oriented hardware MIDI sequencer
designed for DAWless setups, real-time recording, and tactile musical interaction.

Alpha1 records live MIDI performances, routes up to 16 MIDI channels,
and operates completely without a computer.
It emphasizes timing, immediacy, and predictable behavior,
rather than graphical editing or screen-driven workflows.

This repository contains documentation, firmware binaries,
and supporting materials for the Alpha1 Public Alpha release.

## What Alpha1 Is

- A standalone hardware MIDI sequencer
- Designed for recording live MIDI performance
- Supports:
  - Linear and Loop sequencing modes
  - Multi-track recording (up to 16 tracks)
  - A strict **1 track = 1 MIDI channel** relationship
- Can serve as the centerpiece of a DAWless setup
- Requires:
  - A MIDI controller (keyboard / pads) connected to MIDI IN
  - An external sound module or synthesizer connected to MIDI OUT

---

## What Alpha1 Is Not

Alpha1 is not designed to mimic a desktop DAW workflow
or provide graphical MIDI editing.

It does not use:
- Step grids
- Piano-roll views
- Pattern-based sequencing
- Visual note drawing or timeline manipulation

There is no concept of “drawing notes” or editing them on a screen.

Instead, Alpha1 prioritizes:
- Timing
- Musical flow
- Real-time interaction
- Predictable behavior during performance
